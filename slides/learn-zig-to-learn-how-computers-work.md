Ok, jokes aside, here is why Zig is worth learning.

C does not describe **how the computer works**, it describes how the **C abstract machine** works.

**Runtime**, **virtual machine**, and **abstract machine** are different words for the same fundamental thing. But they've since gained different connotations, due to non-essential variance in different implementations of these ideas.

C is fundamentally an abstraction of hardware, and abstractions are leaky.
