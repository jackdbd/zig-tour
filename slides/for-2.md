<!--
We can use a **capture** in a `for` loop. If the captured value is null, the for exits automatically.

We can use a first capture for the value, and a second capture for its index.

- `for` is an expression, like `while`
- `for` can be labeled, like `while`
- `for` can have a `inline` keyword, like `while`
