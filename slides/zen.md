Type <code class="inline-code">zig zen</code> and this is what you get:

```text
* Communicate intent precisely.
* Edge cases matter.
* Favor reading code over writing code.
* Only one obvious way to do things.
* Runtime crashes are better than bugs.
* Compile errors are better than runtime crashes.
* Incremental improvements.
* Avoid local maximums.
* Reduce the amount one must remember.
* Focus on code rather than style.
* Resource allocation may fail; resource deallocation must succeed.
* Memory is a resource.
* Together we serve the users.
```
