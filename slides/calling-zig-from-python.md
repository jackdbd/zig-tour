# Calling Zig from Python

<Transform scale="1">

- Zig **dynamic** library <Anchor href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Exporting-a-C-Library" text="exported to C" /> as <Anchor href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/extending/extending.html?highlight=extension#extending-python-with-c-or-c" text="Python extension module" /> (CPython only)

ABI stable across versions, backward/forward compatibility.

```text
const py = @cImport({
    @cDefine("PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN", {});
    @cInclude("Python.h");
});

<!-- 
When a zig functon is to be consumed by a C ABI, prepend it with `export` instead of `pub`.

I think your Zig library must be compiled as a dynamic library. I don't think ctypes and cffi would work with a static library.

Python provides a Stable ABI: a set of symbols that will remain compatible across Python 3.x versions. The Stable ABI contains symbols exposed in the Limited API, but also other ones â€“ for example, functions necessary to support older versions of the Limited API.
