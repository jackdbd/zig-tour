<p>What does this Python code print?</p>

```python
a = Foo(2)
b = Bar(3)

print(a + b)
print(b + a)

We need to know what <code class="inline-code">+</code> <span class="color:accent">means</span> for <code class="inline-code">a</code> and <code class="inline-code">b</code>.

```python {5-6,12-13|all}
class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n

    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.n + other.n

class Bar(object):
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n

    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.n - other.n
```

</v-click>

<!--
Operator overloading can be very useful, but there is often a concern that it hinders the ability to understand code at first glance: not only may you have to check whether + really means add, but it hides a function call. One of Zig's main objectives is clarity, so this makes operator overloading a no-go.
