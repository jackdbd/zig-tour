# Why Zig?

  text="I know nothing about 'zig', but I do question this obsession with constantly inventing new programming languages. True skilled software engineering is very hard, and takes a lot of experience. Needlessly learning new syntax every few years to 'stay current' represents a huge cognitive drain on programmers."

  text="Simple languages are not that bad IMO. My biggest gripe is when languages are constantly revising and adding new features. I don't care about that stuff. I only want to learn the language once."

Maybe add this class to the Quote component (but only on desktop, not on mobile!):

I find the quote "Needlessly learning new syntax every few years to stay current" quite ironic, given that it comes from a C++ programmer.

Michal Ziulek is the author of zig-gamedev.
