    I know nothing about 'zig', but I do question this obsession with constantly inventing new programming languages. True skilled software engineering is very hard, and takes a lot of experience. Needlessly learning new syntax every few years to 'stay current' represents a huge cognitive drain on programmers.

    Simple languages are not that bad IMO. My biggest gripe is when languages are constantly revising and adding new features. I don't care about that stuff. I only want to learn the language once.

    I know nothing about 'C', but I do question this obsession with inventing higher-level languages. I've been coding about 142 years, coding in x89_66 assembly about 127 years. I'm quite good at it, but not an expert. That's just ONE asm lang.

Maybe add this class to the Quote component (but only on desktop, not on mobile!):

I find the quote "Needlessly learning new syntax every few years to stay current" quite ironic, given that it comes from a C++ programmer.

Michal Ziulek is the author of zig-gamedev.
